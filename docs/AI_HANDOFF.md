# AI Handoff

## Current Phase

PHASE 3A - MINIMAL RAG PROOF OF WORK is in progress. Phase 2 Minimal POW ingestion is working locally and must not be rewritten while Phase 3A is implemented.

## What Exists

- Phase 1 vault folders, templates, docs, Docker Compose, n8n setup, and schema standards.
- Phase 2 prompt chain for classification, routing, normalization, and QA risk checking.
- Phase 2 ingestion contract and routing rules.
- Sample inputs and expected outputs for test-driven workflow buildout.
- Importable n8n workflow export for local validation.
- Helper scripts for filename sanitization, payload validation, metadata validation, Markdown writing, and Git commit/push.
- n8n setup and local testing documentation.
- Phase 3A local RAG scripts under `rag/` for disposable ChromaDB indexing and retrieval-only querying.
- Phase 3A retrieval quality refinement filters low-value sections by default and prioritizes useful evidence sections.

## Continue From Here

Future AI work should:

1. Keep `master` as the official branch.
2. Preserve Markdown in `vault/` as the source of truth.
3. Use `automation/ingestion/ingestion_contract.json` as the canonical payload contract.
4. Use `automation/ingestion/routing_rules.json` for folder routing.
5. Keep prompts modular.
6. Add or refine samples when document type behavior changes.
7. Keep `docs/PHASE_LOG.md` accurate.
8. Keep `workflows/n8n/phase_2_ingestion_workflow.json` inactive by default until local validation is complete.
9. Treat `vault/` Markdown as the source of truth.
10. Treat `rag/chroma/` as disposable derived data.

## Do Not Do Yet

- Do not implement Open WebUI.
- Do not add advanced automations beyond the documented Phase 2 ingestion workflow.
- Do not add autonomous agents, advanced memory systems, or answer generation.
- Do not use cloud embeddings or API keys for Phase 3A.
- Do not start Phase 3B until Phase 3A retrieval ranking is validated.
- Do not commit secrets, real API keys, `.env`, `n8n_data`, or generated credential files.

## Phase 3A Exit Criteria

Phase 3A should only be marked validated after:

- dependencies install from `rag/requirements.txt`;
- `python rag/scripts/index_vault.py` creates a local ChromaDB index;
- `query_vault.py` retrieves Sierra Ridge `post_order` or `qa_rule` chunks for physical ID questions;
- `query_vault.py` retrieves a Monterey `incident` chunk for tailgating questions;
- low-value sections such as `Change History`, `Open Questions`, and `Source Input` do not pollute default top results;
- retrieval quality is inspected before any answer generation is added.

## Phase 2 Exit Criteria

Phase 2 should only be marked complete after:

- n8n workflow imports successfully.
- Sample inputs are run through the prompt chain.
- Generated Markdown is inspected for metadata completeness.
- Routing rules are verified against every supported document type.
- QA risk review behavior is tested.
- Git commit behavior is tested on `master`.

Until then, Phase 2 must remain `IN PROGRESS`.
